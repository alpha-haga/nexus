Follow docs/architecture/ai-rules.md strictly.

- Domain and Application MUST NOT depend on infrastructure
- Database connections MUST exist only in infrastructure
- Repository interfaces belong to domain
- Implementations belong to infrastructure
- If architectural intent is unclear, ASK before applying changes
